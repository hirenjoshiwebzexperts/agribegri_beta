Hence, before cultivating seeds, it is good to have proper knowledge about the crop&#39;s requirements for successful growth. Below is brief information on various crop requirements.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Irrigation:</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The quantity of water depends on various factors, such as soil temperature, soil type, weather conditions, and the type of crop. The frequency of water is not fixed, although most leafy vegetable seeds need 1 to 2 inches of water per week. It is better to keep the soil moist.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Growing Conditions:</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Leafy Vegetable seeds need a 55 to 70 F temperature to grow properly. Most leafy vegetables need good sunlight, a maximum of 4 to 6 hours. They need nutrients and enough space so that air circulation doesn&#39;t stop. The humidity should be 50 to 70%.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Soil Type:</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Remember, the first and most crucial requirement for crops is soil fertility. It&#39;s the foundation of successful crop production. Some leafy vegetables thrive in well-drained, loose, and rich soil, while they struggle in sandy or heavy clay soil.
